Material for the workshop Machine Learning: the basics for everyday use

We will use Jupyter/Python3.6 notebooks (3.5 should work too, 2.7 will not). The main packages we use on top are all part of the Anaconda distribution, so if you have an updated version of that, you should be good to go. One thing to note, is that the last bit of the workshop will only work with scikit-learn version 0.18 or newer.
